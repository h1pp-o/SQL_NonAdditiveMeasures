## Handling Non-Additive Measures with GROUPING SETS() and CUBE() in SQL

In the field of Business Intelligence, slicing-and-dicing measures by numerous dimensions is a common requirement, allowing end users to explore data freely across different perspectives. However, not all measures are straightforward to aggregate. Specifically, non-additive measures such as percentages or averages, which involve a denominator, pose a unique challenge. These measures cannot be simply summed or averaged across dimensions without distorting the data.

Consider the issue mathematically. For non-additive measures, straightforward aggregation can lead to incorrect conclusions because the calculation of averages or percentages across different groups needs to account for the underlying distribution and size of each group.

### Solution: Precomputing Measures

To accurately handle non-additive measures, all calculations must be moved upstream to the data warehouse or pipeline stage. This involves computing all possible combinations of the dimensions involved, essentially pre-aggregating the data at every possible level of detail. By doing so, we ensure that the computed measures are accurate, no matter how the data is sliced-and-diced downstream.

This approach was highlighted in Zach Wilson's Data Engineering Bootcamp, specifically during the Analytical Patterns Day class. It's a powerful strategy for ensuring data integrity across various levels of aggregation.


### Utilizing GROUPING SETS() and CUBE()

SQL offers powerful keywords to facilitate the pre-aggregation of data: GROUPING SETS() and CUBE(). These functions allow for the flexible aggregation of data across multiple dimensions, but they serve slightly different purposes:

- GROUPING SETS() allows for the manual specification of dimension combinations for which you want to aggregate data. This gives you precise control over the aggregation levels and can help manage the volume of data generated by pre-aggregation.

- CUBE() generates all possible combinations of specified dimensions, including the grand total. This is incredibly useful for exhaustive data analysis but can result in a large number of aggregate rows. It's important to be aware that using CUBE() might generate aggregate rows with values that represent overall totals (often indicated with special markers like (overall) due to the use of COALESCE() function). These rows need to be carefully managed, especially when performing date-related window functions, to avoid misinterpretation of the data.


### Enhancing Performance with aggregation_level

To further optimize data analysis and querying performance, we introduce a field named aggregation_level. This field can act as a partition key in your database, significantly improving the read performance by allowing faster data access at the desired level of aggregation.

End users can leverage the aggregation_level field in dashboards or reports to quickly filter the data to a specific level of detail, enhancing their analysis experience and making large datasets more manageable.


### Best Practices and Considerations

Data Volume Management: Precomputing all possible combinations can significantly increase your data storage requirements. It's essential to identify the most relevant dimensions for your analysis needs and possibly limit the depth of pre-aggregation to balance detail and performance.

Performance Optimization: Consider using indexing strategies or materialized views for the most commonly accessed aggregation levels to speed up query performance.
